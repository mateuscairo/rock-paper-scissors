# rock-paper-scissors

First project from The Odin's Project using Javascript. Along this project, I could explore about all basics of Javascript - declaring variables, using functions, conditionals and loops. The project itself its quite simple, but I could develop a functional game with simple concepts that's played in the browser console.
